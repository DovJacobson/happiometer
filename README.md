# The Happiometer
Exercise your smile muscles and track your daily progress.

This is built as my 2025 Happy New Year Card.
Rather than simply wishcasting a Happy New Year to those I love.
I propose instead this silly little app that purports to help them actually achieve it.


## Privacy Commitment
This app uses no cookies. More importantly, it sends _no_ data anywhere.
It stores your history only on your own device.
Your face is analysed only on your own phone or computer.
